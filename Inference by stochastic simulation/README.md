# Inference by the stichastic simulation
I used approximate inference to calculate the conditional probability by stochastic simulation.
Increasing the number of samples causes the
distribution used for probability calculation to become more
realistic, so approximate probability converges to the exact
probability. I obtained the best value for the number of
sampling by trial and error when approximate probability
becomes nearly fixed. <br/>
Three methods were used for random sampling:<br/>
1-Rejection Sampling <br/>
2-Likelihood Weighting Sampling <br/>
3- Gibbs Sampling <br/>
