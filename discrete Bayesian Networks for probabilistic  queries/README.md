## Implementing discrete Bayesian Networks to answer probabilistic queries 
There are two data source and random variables of each of these datasets are:
• Heart Disease: age, gender, chest pain type, BP, cholesterol, FBS over 120, EKG results, 
max HR, exercise angina, ST depression, slope of ST, number of vessels fluro, thallium, 
heart disease
• Stroke: gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, ever married, work type, residence 
type, average glucose level, BMI, smoking status, stroke
The programs were written in Python and it should do the following
to be able to answer probabilistic queries:
1. Read the datasets (in CSV format) available via Blackboard. 
2. Read from a configuration file a predefined structure of each of your Bayesian 
networks or use randomly generated structures.
3. Learn the parameters of the Bayesian networks (one network per dataset) using 
Maximum Likelihood Estimation for example. 
4. Answer probabilistic queries using one of the algorithms provided in the module.
