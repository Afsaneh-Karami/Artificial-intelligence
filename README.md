In this project, I implemented different solutions to calculate conditional and unconditional probabilities and assess their accuracy. I used training data sets to learn parameters for
each solution (method) and executed them to classify test data sets. Then, I compared the classified result on test data with the real value to assess the accuracy. I implemented the Naive Bayes and Bayesian network for the structure. Also, I applied two types of probabilistic inference techniques exact
and approximate.
