In this project, I implemented different solutions to calculate conditional and unconditional probabilities and assess their accuracy. I used training data sets to learn parameters for
each solution (method) and executed them to classify test data sets. Then, I compared the classified result on test data with the real value to assess the accuracy. I implemented the Naive Bayes and Bayesian network for the structure. Also, I applied two types of probabilistic inference techniques exact
and approximate.<br/>
There are two data source and random variables of each of these datasets are:<br/>
• Heart Disease: age, gender, chest pain type, BP, cholesterol, FBS over 120, EKG results, 
max HR, exercise angina, ST depression, slope of ST, number of vessels fluro, thallium, 
heart disease<br/>
• Stroke: gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, ever married, work type, residence 
type, average glucose level, BMI, smoking status, stroke<br/>
